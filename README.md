## 📌 Introduction  

### 🚀 Overview
**Maseer** is an **AI-powered solution** designed to **automate** the detection and identification of **traffic priority violations** using video footage from regular drivers' **Dashcams**. By leveraging **computer vision** and **machine learning**, Maseer processes Dashcam recordings to **identify specific traffic violations**, addressing gaps in **traditional traffic monitoring systems**. This approach enhances **road safety** and **empowers drivers** to contribute to **law enforcement efforts**, streamlining **violation reporting** while protecting their **rights**.

### 🎯 Objectives
✅ **Leverage Dashcam footage** → Minimize the need for physical traffic police presence.  
✅ **Automate violation detection** → Reduce the workload for both Dashcam owners and traffic authorities.  
✅ **Facilitate data-driven reporting** → Assist victims of priority violations in filing accurate reports.  
✅ **Enhance traffic management** → Utilize advanced technology for precise and efficient violation monitoring.  




## 🚦 Detected Traffic Violations  
Maseer focuses on detecting and identifying **traffic priority violations**, specifically **sudden lane change violations**. This violation occurs when a driver **fails to yield to a vehicle already in the target lane** while switching lanes, creating a hazardous situation. The violation is characterized by:

🚗 **A vehicle attempting to switch lanes without yielding to a vehicle already in that lane**, causing potential accidents.  
📏 **A minimum safe distance of three meters is not maintained** between vehicles, leading to unsafe conditions.  
⚠️ **Sudden and reckless lane changes** disrupt traffic flow and increase accident risks.

Further explanation of this violation is illustrated in above figure. In this scenario, **Vehicle A** holds priority in its current lane. If **Vehicle B** intends to switch to the left lane, it must wait for **Vehicle A** to pass before changing lanes. A violation occurs if **Vehicle B** does not yield, cuts too closely in front of **Vehicle A**, and disrupts its passage—placing both vehicles at risk.

## 🛠 How Detection Works  
Maseer follows a structured pipeline to detect traffic violations:  

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Video frames are extracted and processed.  
   - Objects (vehicles, traffic signals, lanes) are detected using deep learning models.  

2. **Violation Detection Pipeline**  
   - **Object Detection**: Identifies vehicles and traffic signals.  
   - **Rule-Based Analysis**: Determines whether a violation occurs (e.g., car crosses red light).  

3. **Deep Learning Models**  
   - **YOLOv8**: Fast and efficient object detection.  
   - **Faster R-CNN**: High-accuracy vehicle detection.  
   - **Custom Models**: Trained for specific violation types.

## 📊 Models Used  

| Model       | Purpose                     | Accuracy |
|------------|----------------------------|----------|
| YOLOv8     | Vehicle & signal detection  | 92%      |
| Faster R-CNN | High-precision detection  | 95%      |
| Custom CNN | Classification tasks        | 89%      |

🚀 **Why YOLOv8?**  
- Real-time performance  
- High accuracy in traffic scenarios  
- Efficient processing for large datasets

## 📄 Generated Output  
Maseer generates multiple output formats to report violations:  

- **Annotated Images**: Bounding boxes highlight violations.  
- **JSON Reports**: Structured logs of detected violations.  
- **Video Processing**: Marking detected violations in footage.  

📝 **Example Output (JSON)**  
```json
{
    "violation": "Red Light Violation",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-01T10:30:00Z",
    "vehicle_id": "ABC-123",
    "location": "Main Street Intersection"
}
```
