## 📌 Introduction  
Maseer is an advanced traffic violation detection system that leverages computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect and report traffic violations. By analyzing video footage, Maseer can identify violations such as red light running, illegal parking, and wrong-way driving.  

🚀 **Key Technologies:**  
- **Computer Vision** (OpenCV, image processing techniques)  
- **Deep Learning** (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN)  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## 🚦 Detected Traffic Violations  
Maseer is designed to detect multiple traffic violations, including:  

1. **Red Light Violation** 🚨  
   - Vehicles crossing an intersection after the light turns red.  
2. **Illegal Parking** 🚗  
   - Detecting parked cars in restricted zones.  
3. **Wrong-Way Driving** 🔄  
   - Vehicles moving against the permitted direction.  
4. **Speeding (Future Work)** ⚡  
   - Identifying vehicles exceeding the speed limit.  

Each violation is detected using object tracking, lane detection, and rule-based logic to ensure accuracy.

## 🛠 How Detection Works  
Maseer follows a structured pipeline to detect traffic violations:  

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Video frames are extracted and processed.  
   - Objects (vehicles, traffic signals, lanes) are detected using deep learning models.  

2. **Violation Detection Pipeline**  
   - **Object Detection**: Identifies vehicles and traffic signals.  
   - **Rule-Based Analysis**: Determines whether a violation occurs (e.g., car crosses red light).  

3. **Deep Learning Models**  
   - **YOLOv8**: Fast and efficient object detection.  
   - **Faster R-CNN**: High-accuracy vehicle detection.  
   - **Custom Models**: Trained for specific violation types.

## 📊 Models Used  

| Model       | Purpose                     | Accuracy |
|------------|----------------------------|----------|
| YOLOv8     | Vehicle & signal detection  | 92%      |
| Faster R-CNN | High-precision detection  | 95%      |
| Custom CNN | Classification tasks        | 89%      |

🚀 **Why YOLOv8?**  
- Real-time performance  
- High accuracy in traffic scenarios  
- Efficient processing for large datasets

## 📄 Generated Output  
Maseer generates multiple output formats to report violations:  

- **Annotated Images**: Bounding boxes highlight violations.  
- **JSON Reports**: Structured logs of detected violations.  
- **Video Processing**: Marking detected violations in footage.  

📝 **Example Output (JSON)**  
```json
{
    "violation": "Red Light Violation",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-01T10:30:00Z",
    "vehicle_id": "ABC-123",
    "location": "Main Street Intersection"
}
```

```

### 🚀 Running the Detection System
```bash
python detect_violations.py --input video.mp4
```

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation  
Maseer has been rigorously tested on real-world traffic footage to ensure high accuracy and robustness in detecting traffic violations.  

### 📊 Performance Metrics  
The system was evaluated using a dataset of annotated traffic videos, measuring key performance indicators such as precision, recall, and F1-score.  

| Metric    | Score  |
|-----------|--------|
| Precision | 91%    |
| Recall    | 89%    |
| F1-Score  | 90%    |
